**For loop - Number swapping**

For this project I used a For Loop to swap the first and the last numbers a user enters. 
When a user enters a number into a prompt, the number is logged and an array is created from the number after it is split. 
I then used an if/else statement and a for loop to swap the first and last entries of the array. 
The full number with the swapped digits is then output back to the user.

**While loop - A Palindrome**

To showcase my While Loop skills, I asked the user to enter a word and the While Loop then checked if it is a palindrome or not. 
To do this I promted the user for a word and logged that word back to the user, changed it into lower case and split it into letters.
An if statement and a while loop then compared the first and last letters of the word, breaking off if the letters don't match or if it reaches the middle.
Depending on the outcome, a diagnosis of Palindrome or not was then presented back to the user in the console.
